# Aiming.Team Check
```lua
<<bool> success> Aiming.TeamCheck(<bool> Toggle)
```
Due to the nature of how the ignore system works, I have made a simple function that lets you toggle the same team check on and off by adding or removing your team from the ignored teams

## Parameters
* `bool` Toggle
> Whether to toggle team check on and off

## Returns
* `Part` The target part
